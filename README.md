# File-Upload-UI-using-React
I have created a File Uploading Interface which accepts only the .csv, .xls, and .xlsx extension files along with the upload percentage bar.

To run on your device:-
1: Give command npm run dev after downloading the codes and by creating the npm create vite@latest.
2: You will get a local host link then paste in your browser to see the changes you made available or the output.
